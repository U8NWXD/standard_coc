# Code of Conduct

This is a standard code of conduct applied to many of my personal
projects. The projects where it applies will include a reference to this
code.

Note that while this code is based on the Contributor Covenant, it has
been modified throughout. Please actually read it; do not just assume it
is the Contributor Covenant.

## Why a Code of Conduct

Like any community with a common goal, we are individuals collaborating
with each other. This inherently requires that project members develop
relationships with each other, and like any human relationship, these
collaborations are easier and more effective when clear expectations are
set. This code of conduct is meant to set those expectations -- to make
sure we are all on the same page about what behavior is acceptable in
this community. This helps to prevent and resolve conflicts, and it
welcomes new contributors.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. This is
not indended to be an exhaustive list; rather, it serves to emphasize
that we recognize the potential for abuse based on these characteristics
and that such abuse has no place in our community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Keeping behavior respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Keeping actions focused on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Note that these are standards of *behavior*, not of *beliefs*. Everyone
involved in this project is free to hold whatever beliefs they choose;
it is only our behavior with respect to this project that we agree must
meet these standards.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at cs.temporary@icloud.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team will
work to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
However, keep in mind that confidentiality may need to be broken in
response to legal requirements or to protect a person's or group's
safety or property.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
